### 2. Understanding the Quotex Verification Process

#### Why is Account Verification Important?

Before diving into the steps, let\'s take a moment to understand why the
Quotex verification process is necessary. By verifying your trading
account, Quotex ensures that you are a legitimate trader and protects
both you and other users from fraudulent activities. It helps maintain a
secure trading environment where you can trade with confidence.

#### Types of Verification Documents

During the Quotex verification process, you will be required to submit

The duration of the Quotex verification process varies depending on
several factors such as the volume of requests and the accuracy of the
submitted documents. On average, the verification process takes
approximately 1-3 business days. However, it is important to note that
this timeframe is an estimate, and the process may take longer in some
cases.

### 3. How to Verify Your Quotex Trading Account

#### Step 1: Registering an Account

To initiate the verification process, you first need to register an
account on the Quotex platform. This can be done by visiting their
official website or downloading their mobile application from your
respective app store. Fill in the required information accurately to
proceed to the next step.

#### Step 2: Providing Personal Information

After successfully registering an account, you will be prompted to
provide personal information such as your full name, date of birth, and
contact details. It is crucial to enter this information accurately to
avoid any unnecessary delays during the verification process.

Once you have provided the necessary personal information, it\'s time to
submit the required documents for verification. Quotex will guide you
through the document upload process, allowing you to conveniently attach
the necessary files directly from your device. Ensure that the documents

Suppose you choose to submit your national ID card as your
